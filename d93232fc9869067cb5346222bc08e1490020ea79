      "message": "So, it looks like the navigation bar frame is being used as that \"buffer zone\" that I referred to in my previous comment.\n\nRemoving this line does completely resolve the usability issues that I mentioned previously, but it does result in that nav bar hint being drawn on top of the app (since the app is taking up the entire screen now). I will try to figure out how I could hide the \"home_handle\" button (nav bar hint) via overlays...\n\n(I hadn\u0027t checked it myself yet, but I suspect that this line also ends up hiding the \"back\" and \"ime_switcher\" buttons that show up when you have your keyboard open, which is probably not what we want either)",
